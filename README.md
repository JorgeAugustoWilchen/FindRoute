# FindRoute
## (W.I.P)
A simple cpp code to solve CPP problems (Coverage Path Planning).

This is a project to help you find the best way to cover all selected areas of an array.
I chose c++ to have better performance, considering embedded software

# Functions
coveragePathPlanning: set a grid (and optionally a start and end location) to return the (std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>) path percuring all matrix nodes with value 1.

smallPath: set a grid, start and end location to return the (std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>) path percuring the smallest path to point A to point B.
